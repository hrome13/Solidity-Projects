# Solidity-Projects
Personal projects for the blockchain using Solidity. I've recently learned the basics of Solidity via the CryptoZombies tutorials, and I'm using these projects to learn even more.

CryptoCarting is a blockchain car racing game using ERC-721 tokens as the car parts as well as the drivers.

ETH-FC is a blockchain soccer game using ERC-721 tokens as the players.
